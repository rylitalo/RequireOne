# RequireOne

## Java Swing Aquire Game

Based on the 1960's 3M Bookshelf game Aquire.

While the AI isn't particularly intelligent, it is functional.  While you should be able to win
fairly easily if you understand the game, it is a good way for beginners to learn the rules and
the mechanics of how the game is played.

## Build the Game
Run **./gradlew createJar** - this builds an executable jar file.

## Run the Game
Run the executable jar file created from the gradle createJar  command, which is generated in
build/libs/RequireOne-all-1.0.jar

**java -jar RequireOne-all-1.0.jar**
