# RequireOne

## Java Swing Aquire Game

I developed this game on whim a while back when on a family vacation.  My kid brother-in-law
was wondering what programming was.  I figured I'd demonstrate how to build an acquire game 
(since he was familiar with the mechanics of the game itself).  Over the course of a couple 
days, I created a fairly functional implementation of the game where one player can play against
three other computer players.

While the AI isn't particularly intelligent, it is functional.  While you should be able to win
fairly easily if you understand the game, it is a good way for beginners to learn the rules and
the mechanics of how the game is played.

## Build the Game
Run **gradle createJar** - this builds an executable jar file.

## Run the Game
Run the executable jar file created from the **gradle createJar**  command, which is generated in
**build/libs/RequireOne-all-1.0.jar**

**java -jar RequireOne-all-1.0.jar**


## Acquire Rules
